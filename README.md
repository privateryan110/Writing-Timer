# Writing-Timer
A timer useful to help keep myself in the flow when writing/doing work.

I found having a sound play at a set interval was a fantastic way to keep myself focused. If I space out or go on my phone, the sound will remind me that I am supposed to be working. 

Could really use it right now actually.

Type in the number of minutes and seconds you want the period of the timer to be (default is 60 seconds)
When you hit play you will hear a beep and see the circle start to fill, that beep will repeat at the defined interval 

NOTE: must keep browser window open or else the writing timer will pause.
